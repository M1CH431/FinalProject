LIBRARIES I USED:

I use the BASS API (http://bass.radio42.com/) which is a .NET wrapper for Un4seen BASS Audio Libraray(http://www.un4seen.com/). I am using this so that I can extract
frequencies from the audio playing on the Bass.Net stream. I am not allowed to use my registration code since I will be sending you this project so there may or may not be 
a splash screen (they said there would be, but I've never seen one).


HOW TO USE:

To use this application, once you have started it, you will need to create a user (you can use whatever kind of characters you want), then click create user.

If you already made an account just type in the credentials and click login.
(User data is saved to "bin/debug/Users")

Now you should be on the selection page.

You can press logout if you wish, which will take you back the login screen

Once on the selection page you must select one song (I have pre-downloaded songs that should have loaded for you) and you must select one visualizer.
(If you want, you can download any mp3 and place it in the music directory located in "bin/debug/Music")

Now that you have selected a song and visualizer you can click on the visualize button.

You should now be on the visualization page.

The screen will be completely black with two buttons and a slider.

The back button will stop the stream and take you back to the selection page.

The play button will start the stream and turns into a pause button when clicked, now the button will say pause and when that is clicked the stream is paused and so on.

The slider in between the two buttons controlls the volume (It starts at full volume and can be slid all the way to 0 volume)

THAT'S IT!

Side note: When on the visualization page you can press the back button whenever (even when the stream is not paused) and it will work just fine.
